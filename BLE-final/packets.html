      <p>
        &emsp;Using Wireshark we can capture the packets sent between the watch
        and phone. As we can see in the photo above, we have a connection, noted
        as "Master" and "Slave", outdated terms, but with a little investigating
        we are able to find the MAC address of the watch and phone, and use
        those to figure out which one is the Client and which is the Server.
      </p>

      </a>
      <div class="lightbox-target" id="M/S">
        <img src="./assets/master-slave.png" alt="Client/Server" />
        <a class="lightbox-close" href="#"></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        &emsp;Knowing that the watches MAC address is the one ending in 0b:34 we
        can see that the "Slave" is the is the server and the "Master" is the
        Client. When we open one of the captured packets, we see some
        information of interest. First, we should sort by protocol type. A lot
        of packets captured for BLE are broadcast packets and although they can
        be of some use, that's beyond the scope of this project. For BLE
        sniffing, what we are interested in is the "Bluetooth Low Energy Link
        Layer". We see a few drop down menu's that we can select from. The one
        we're interested in is the "Information Data, Handle" drop down. As
        previously mentioned, there are a standard set of UUID's that are
        reserved for certain characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;On the watch, if we open up the Heart Rate Monitor while recording
        packets in Wireshark, soon we'll capture a packet that has the UUID of
        0x2A37 just as in the photo below.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        &emsp;This confirms that we're successfully intercepting packets! Now
        that it's confirmed we're looking at the right Client/Server pair, we
        can use the nRF Connect app provided by Nordic to exploit our findings.
        When we open the app, we need to begin scanning again so that we can
        connect to the Server.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        &emsp;Once we connect, we're able to send and receive commands from the
        app. Below is a screenshot of the nRF connect app, ready to read and
        write data.
