        &emsp;This project was a lot of fun to work on and a great introduction
        to sniffing bluetooth. Reflecting back, I wish I had chosen a simpler
        device to start sniffing, such as a smart lightbulb or a smart lock. I
        was hoping to be able to get an exploit working that would have allowed
        me to spoof the watch and send the phone the command to take a picture,
        something that can be done from the watch, but I wasn't able to get it
        working in time. It felt like most of my time was spent trying to figure
        out specifics for my device which don't transfer to a report very well.
        I was able to make some headway and figure out the service UUID by
        repeatedly taking photos from the watch and scanning with Wireshark, but
        I wasn't able to figure out the correct data to send with nRF connect.
        This will be an ongoing project though, and I'm planning on getting some
        more BLE devices that I can try to build my skills up with.

        &emsp;This was also the first website I've worked on in a while, and the
        first I've gotten to do for school. Hopefully it came out alright and I
        hope it was informative for you as well...
